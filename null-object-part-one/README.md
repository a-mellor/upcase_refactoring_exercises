# Notes

### Required
Create a class following the Null Object pattern in order to encapsulate conditional logic.

##### Exercise instructions

1. Open lib/user.rb
2. Look for conditionals related to nil.
3. Introduce a Null Object. Think of a good name based on what nil represents in this context.
4. Replace a single conditional by moving the nil logic to the Null Object.
5. Repeat step four until the nil cases are fully encapsulated within the Null Object.
6. Make sure all tests pass by running ```rspec```.

My attempt is in ```my_solution``` branch
